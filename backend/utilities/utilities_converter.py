def Absolute_position(parent_absolute_position, parent_heading, relative_position):
    """
    Convert a relative position to an absolute position in 3D space given a parent's 
    absolute position and heading in the NED reference frame.
    
    This function transforms coordinates from a local reference frame (relative to a parent object)
    to a global NED reference frame. It applies rotation about the z-axis (yaw/heading) and then 
    translates by the parent's absolute position. Roll and pitch are assumed to be zero.
    
    Args:
        parent_absolute_position (tuple or list): The (north, east, down) coordinates of the parent 
            in the absolute/global NED reference frame.
        parent_heading (float): The heading/yaw angle of the parent in radians. This is the 
            rotation about the down-axis, measured clockwise from North when looking down.
        relative_position (tuple or list): The (north, east, down) coordinates in the parent's local 
            reference frame that need to be converted to absolute coordinates.
    
    Returns:
        tuple: The (north, east, down) absolute position in the global NED reference frame.
